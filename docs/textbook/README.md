# Banking System Textbook

> **Historical documentation:** this book was written for the previous product scope and
> contains descriptions of payment-gateway and loan code that has since been removed.
> It is not an implementation guide for the current simulator. Use the approved
> [`../../.azure/project-plan.md`](../../.azure/project-plan.md) and current
> [`../../README.md`](../../README.md) as the source of truth.

This documentation set turns the Banking System project into a software-engineering walkthrough. It is written for a computer-science student who wants to rebuild the application without AI by understanding the architecture, the folders, the files, the dependencies, and the runtime flows.

## How to Read This Book

1. Start with Chapters 1-3 to understand the problem, architecture, and folder layout.
2. Read Chapters 4-10 to understand backend design, frontend design, testing, deployment, and rebuild order.
3. Use the appendices when you want line-by-line study of a specific file.
4. Keep the source tree open while reading; the appendices quote the source, but navigating the real files trains your engineering eye.

## Coverage Boundary

Covered: source-controlled backend code, frontend code, resources, SQL migrations, tests, CI, Docker, Maven, npm, TypeScript, and static assets.

Excluded: generated or downloaded output such as `frontend/node_modules/`, `frontend/dist/`, `backend/target/`, `.git/`, and IDE metadata. Those are products of the build or local machine, not the project design.
