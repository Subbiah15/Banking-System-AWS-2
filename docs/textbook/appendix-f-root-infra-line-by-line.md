# Appendix F: Root Infrastructure and Project Documents

This appendix covers repository-level documentation, environment templates, Docker Compose, Git ignore rules, and CI workflow files.

> Reading note: each section includes the file purpose, import/dependency role, complete source listing where the file is textual, and a line-by-line walkthrough. Generated dependency/build directories are excluded from this book.


## `.env.example`

### File Purpose
The environment variable template: it documents configurable secrets, ports, database credentials, Redis settings, and frontend API URLs without committing real secrets.

**Why it exists:** This file owns one small part of the system so the rest of the project does not duplicate that responsibility.

**How the project depends on it:** Build tools, Spring Boot, React, tests, or runtime code load it from its path and expect the behavior described here.

**What would happen if removed:** The related module would fail to compile, lose a route/configuration/schema asset, or stop documenting an important workflow.

### Imports
No language-level imports are declared in this file. It either defines configuration/data, uses only built-in syntax, or is an asset/documentation file.

### Code Walkthrough
1. <code># Copy to .env and adjust. .env is gitignored.</code> - Comment/documentation. The compiler or interpreter ignores it at runtime, but it records intent for maintainers.
2. <em>blank line</em> - Blank separator. It has no runtime behavior; it improves human parsing and keeps related code grouped.
3. <code># --- Database ---</code> - Comment/documentation. The compiler or interpreter ignores it at runtime, but it records intent for maintainers.
4. <code>POSTGRES_DB=banking</code> - Environment-template line. Shells or Docker Compose read assignments from real `.env` files, while this example documents expected keys.

### Functions
No explicit functions or methods are declared here. The file is declarative, data-oriented, or framework configuration consumed by tools.

### Common Mistakes
- Editing this file without understanding which tool or framework consumes it.
- Changing names or paths without updating callers, imports, routes, migrations, or build configuration.
- Treating generated/runtime behavior as magic instead of following the call path from this file to its consumer.

### Possible Improvements
- Add targeted comments only where future readers need extra context.
- Add or update tests when behavior changes.
- Keep responsibilities narrow so the file remains easy to reason about.

**Why it exists:** This file owns one small part of the system so the rest of the project does not duplicate that responsibility.

**How the project depends on it:** Build tools, Spring Boot, React, tests, or runtime code load it from its path and expect the behavior described here.

**What would happen if removed:** The related module would fail to compile, lose a route/configuration/schema asset, or stop documenting an important workflow.

    # Banking System — Build Plan

## Context

A **resume-grade, deployed banking system** with a Java/Spring Boot backend and a React web frontend, covering the full breadth of banking features (accounts & auth, transactions & transfers, cards & payments, loans & interest). The goal is to impress recruiters/engineers who view it — so the plan optimizes for **correct domain modeling (double-entry ledger), real security, clean architecture, observability, and a live deployment** with a polished UI and great docs.

> ⚠️ This is a **simulated** bank (no real money / no real banking license). We integrate **Stripe in test mode** for cards/payments so it behaves realistically and safely.

---

## Recommended Architecture: Modular Monolith (microservices-ready)

A **modular monolith** is the right call for a solo, deployable, resume project: it ships fast, deploys cheaply, and demonstrates clean domain boundaries — while being structured so each module *could* be split into a microservice later (a strong "evolution path" talking point in interviews).

## Tech Stack

### Backend
- **Java 21**, **Spring Boot 3.x**, **Maven**
- **Spring Web** (REST), **Spring Data JPA / Hibernate**
- **Spring Security** + **JWT** (access + refresh tokens), **BCrypt**, optional **TOTP 2FA**
- **PostgreSQL** — primary datastore (ACID, the ledger lives here)
- **Redis** — caching, refresh-token store, rate limiting, idempotency keys
- **Kafka or RabbitMQ** — async domain events (notifications, audit, statements)
- **Flyway** — versioned DB migrations
- **springdoc-openapi** — auto-generated Swagger UI
- **MapStruct** (DTO mapping) + **Lombok** (boilerplate)
- **Stripe Java SDK** — cards & payments (test mode)

### Frontend
- **React + TypeScript**, **Vite**, **TailwindCSS**
- **React Query** (server state) + **Zustand or Redux Toolkit** (client state)
- **React Router**, **React Hook Form + Zod** (validation)
- **Recharts** (balance/spend charts), **shadcn/ui** components

### Infra / DevOps
- **Docker** + **docker-compose** (local: app + Postgres + Redis + Kafka)
- **GitHub Actions** — build, test, lint, Docker push
- **Testing**: JUnit 5, Mockito, **Testcontainers** (real Postgres in tests), Spring Boot Test
- **Observability**: Spring Actuator, Prometheus, Grafana, Logback JSON logs

### Deployment (AWS only)
- **Backend, database, and cache**: Amazon ECS on Fargate with an Application Load Balancer, Amazon RDS for PostgreSQL, and Amazon ElastiCache for Redis in private subnets.
- **Frontend**: private Amazon S3 bucket served through CloudFront.
- **Operations and security**: AWS Secrets Manager, CloudWatch, Route 53, and ACM.

## Core Domain Model (key entities)

The single most resume-impressive decision: a **double-entry ledger**. Every movement of money creates balanced debit + credit `LedgerEntry` rows; account balances are derived/maintained from entries. This is how real banks work and signals serious domain understanding.

- **User / Role** — auth identity, RBAC (CUSTOMER, ADMIN, SUPPORT)
- **Customer** — KYC profile (name, DOB, address, verification status)
- **Account** — type (SAVINGS/CHECKING), currency, status, balance (with **optimistic locking** `@Version`)
- **Transaction** — a business event; groups balanced `LedgerEntry` rows
- **LedgerEntry** — `accountId`, `debit/credit`, `amount`, immutable
- **Transfer** — internal/external; carries an **idempotency key** to prevent double-spend
- **Card** — tokenized (never store raw PAN), type, status, spend limits
- **Payment** — Stripe payment intent linkage
- **Loan / RepaymentSchedule** — principal, interest rate, amortization schedule
- **Beneficiary** — saved payees
- **Notification** — async, event-driven
- **AuditLog** — append-only record of sensitive actions

**Money correctness rules:** use `BigDecimal` (never `double`) for money; wrap balance changes in DB transactions; enforce idempotency on transfers/payments; optimistic locking to avoid lost updates.

---

## Build Plan (phased, each phase independently demoable)

**Phase 0 — Scaffold & infra**
- `git init`, Spring Initializr backend, Vite frontend, `docker-compose.yml` (Postgres, Redis, Kafka)
- Flyway baseline migration, OpenAPI/Swagger, Actuator health, global exception handler, base CI workflow.

**Phase 1 — Auth & Users** *(foundation for everything)*
- Registration, login, JWT access+refresh, BCrypt, RBAC, refresh-token rotation in Redis.
- KYC profile + admin verification. Frontend: signup/login/profile.

**Phase 2 — Accounts & Ledger**
- Account CRUD, double-entry `Transaction`/`LedgerEntry`, deposits/withdrawals, balance derivation, optimistic locking.
- Frontend: dashboard with balances + transaction history.

**Phase 3 — Transfers**
- Internal transfers (ledger-backed, atomic), idempotency keys, beneficiaries, transaction statuses.
- Frontend: transfer flow + beneficiary management.

**Phase 4 — Cards & Payments**
- Stripe test-mode integration: issue virtual cards, payment intents, webhooks, tokenization, spend limits.
- Frontend: card management + payment/checkout demo.

**Phase 5 — Loans & Interest**
- Loan application + admin approval, amortization schedule generation, scheduled-job interest accrual, repayments via ledger.
- Frontend: loan apply + repayment schedule view + charts.

**Phase 6 — Notifications, Audit, Admin**
- Async event-driven notifications (email via Mailtrap), append-only audit log, admin portal (users, accounts, KYC, loans).

**Phase 7 — Harden & Deploy**
- Rate limiting, input validation, security headers, refresh-token revocation.
- Testcontainers integration tests, ≥70% coverage on core money logic.
- Prometheus/Grafana dashboards, structured logging.
- Provision the AWS networking and managed services; deploy the backend to ECS/Fargate and frontend to S3/CloudFront; configure HTTPS and verify health.
- **README**: architecture diagram, live demo link, demo credentials, screenshots, GIFs.

```

---

## Verification (how we'll prove it works)

- **Unit/integration**: `./mvnw test` with Testcontainers spinning a real Postgres; assert ledger always balances (sum of debits == credits) and transfers are idempotent.
- **API**: Swagger UI (`/swagger-ui.html`) to exercise every endpoint; Postman collection committed to repo.
- **End-to-end manual**: sign up → create account → deposit → transfer → issue card → make a Stripe test payment → apply for loan → see repayment schedule → receive notification. Verify balances reconcile against the ledger.
- **Stripe**: use test cards (e.g. `4242 4242 4242 4242`) and confirm webhooks update payment status.
- **Deploy smoke test**: hit the live URL, run the same e2e flow against production with seeded demo creds.
- **Observability**: confirm `/actuator/health` is UP and Grafana shows request/latency metrics.

---

## Optional Enhancements (great interview talking points)
- Microservices split (API gateway + per-domain services) as a documented evolution.
- Event sourcing for the ledger; scheduled monthly statement PDFs.
- 2FA (TOTP), fraud-detection rules, multi-currency with FX rates.
- Kubernetes deployment; AWS (ECS/RDS/ElastiCache) instead of PaaS.

### Functions
No explicit functions or methods are declared here. The file is declarative, data-oriented, or framework configuration consumed by tools.

### Common Mistakes
- Editing this file without understanding which tool or framework consumes it.
- Changing names or paths without updating callers, imports, routes, migrations, or build configuration.
- Treating generated/runtime behavior as magic instead of following the call path from this file to its consumer.

### Possible Improvements
- Add targeted comments only where future readers need extra context.
- Add or update tests when behavior changes.
- Keep responsibilities narrow so the file remains easy to reason about.

## `README.md`

### File Purpose
The public project introduction: it explains the product, completed phases, API surface, and local run commands.

**Why it exists:** This file owns one small part of the system so the rest of the project does not duplicate that responsibility.

**How the project depends on it:** Build tools, Spring Boot, React, tests, or runtime code load it from its path and expect the behavior described here.

**What would happen if removed:** The related module would fail to compile, lose a route/configuration/schema asset, or stop documenting an important workflow.

### Imports
No language-level imports are declared in this file. It either defines configuration/data, uses only built-in syntax, or is an asset/documentation file.

# Banking System

A simulated, full-stack banking platform built to demonstrate clean architecture,
correct money handling (double-entry ledger), security, and a real deployment.

> ⚠️ Simulated bank — no real money. Cards/payments use **Stripe test mode** (added in Phase 4).

- **Backend:** Java 21, Spring Boot 3.5, Spring Security, JPA, PostgreSQL, Redis, Flyway, springdoc/OpenAPI
- **Frontend:** React 19 + TypeScript, Vite, Tailwind CSS, React Query, React Router
- **Infra:** Docker Compose (Postgres + Redis), GitHub Actions CI, Testcontainers

See [`PROJECT_PLAN.md`](./PROJECT_PLAN.md) for the full architecture and phased roadmap.

## Project status

- **Phase 0 — Scaffold & infra ✅**
- **Phase 1 — Auth & users ✅** — registration, login, JWT access + rotating
  refresh tokens (Redis), RBAC, KYC profiles, admin verification, signup/login/profile UI.
- **Phase 2 — Accounts & ledger ✅** — open accounts, deposits/withdrawals on a
  **double-entry ledger** (balanced debit/credit entries, `BigDecimal`, pessimistic
  locking, running balance), dashboard + account detail UI with transaction history.
- **Phase 3 — Transfers & beneficiaries ✅** — account-to-account transfers with
  **idempotency keys** (a retried request never double-spends), saved payees, transfer UI.
- **Phase 4 — Cards & payments ✅** — tokenized **virtual cards** (one-time PAN, freeze/cancel,
  monthly spend limits), card purchases that debit the account, and **account top-ups** through a
  **Stripe**-or-simulated payment gateway (idempotent fulfilment).
- **Phase 5 — Loans & interest ✅** (current) — loan applications (KYC-gated), admin approval that
  generates an **amortization schedule** and disburses the principal, installment **repayments**,
  and a **scheduled job** that flags overdue installments. All disbursements/repayments flow
  through the ledger. Loans UI + (admin) approvals panel.

The five core banking domains are complete. Remaining roadmap: notifications, audit log, observability, and deployment.

### Loans API (Phase 5)

| Method | Path | Auth | Purpose |
|---|---|---|---|
| POST | `/api/v1/loans` | bearer | Apply for a loan (requires verified KYC) |
| GET | `/api/v1/loans` `/{id}` | bearer | List / view loan + amortization schedule |
| POST | `/api/v1/loans/{id}/repay` | bearer | Pay the next installment |
| GET | `/api/v1/admin/loans` | ADMIN | List loans (optional `?status=PENDING`) |
| POST | `/api/v1/admin/loans/{id}/approve` `/reject` | ADMIN | Approve (disburse + schedule) / reject |

Equal monthly payments via the standard amortization formula (`BigDecimal`, configurable
`app.loans.annual-rate`, default 12%). A daily `@Scheduled` job marks overdue installments.

### Cards & Payments API (Phase 4)

| Method | Path | Auth | Purpose |
|---|---|---|---|
| POST | `/api/v1/cards` | bearer | Issue a virtual card (full number returned once) |
| GET | `/api/v1/cards` | bearer | List my cards |
| POST | `/api/v1/cards/{id}/freeze` `/unfreeze` `/cancel` | bearer | Card lifecycle |
| POST | `/api/v1/cards/{id}/pay` | bearer | Card purchase (debits the account) |
| POST | `/api/v1/payments/top-up` | bearer | Start a top-up (gateway intent) |
| POST | `/api/v1/payments/{id}/confirm` | bearer | Confirm a top-up (simulated gateway) |
| POST | `/api/v1/payments/webhook` | public | Stripe-signed webhook (real mode) |

**Payment gateway:** runs in **simulated** mode by default (no secrets — top-ups confirm via
the `/confirm` endpoint). Set `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY` to switch to **real Stripe test mode**
(PaymentIntents + signature-verified webhooks):

```bash
# .env
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=sk_test_...
STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET=whsec_...
# forward Stripe webhooks to the app, then pay with test card 4242 4242 4242 4242
stripe listen --forward-to localhost:8080/api/v1/payments/webhook
```

### Transfers API (Phase 3)

| Method | Path | Auth | Purpose |
|---|---|---|---|
| POST | `/api/v1/transfers` | bearer | Transfer money (send `Idempotency-Key` header) |
| GET | `/api/v1/beneficiaries` | bearer | List saved payees |
| POST | `/api/v1/beneficiaries` | bearer | Save a payee |
| DELETE | `/api/v1/beneficiaries/{id}` | bearer | Delete a payee |

Supplying an `Idempotency-Key` makes a transfer safe to retry: the server posts the
underlying ledger transaction at most once per key.

### Accounts API (Phase 2)

| Method | Path | Auth | Purpose |
|---|---|---|---|
| POST | `/api/v1/accounts` | bearer | Open an account (CHECKING/SAVINGS) |
| GET | `/api/v1/accounts` | bearer | List my accounts |
| GET | `/api/v1/accounts/{id}` | bearer | Get one account |
| POST | `/api/v1/accounts/{id}/deposit` | bearer | Deposit (amount) |
| POST | `/api/v1/accounts/{id}/withdraw` | bearer | Withdraw (amount, no overdraft) |
| GET | `/api/v1/accounts/{id}/transactions` | bearer | Transaction history (newest first) |

Every money movement posts a balanced set of ledger entries (debits + credits net to
zero) against the customer account and a system settlement account, in one DB transaction.

### Auth API (Phase 1)

| Method | Path | Auth | Purpose |
|---|---|---|---|
| POST | `/api/v1/auth/register` | public | Create a customer, returns tokens |
| POST | `/api/v1/auth/login` | public | Authenticate, returns tokens |
| POST | `/api/v1/auth/refresh` | public | Rotate refresh token → new pair |
| POST | `/api/v1/auth/logout` | public | Revoke a refresh token |
| GET | `/api/v1/users/me` | bearer | Current user + KYC profile |
| PUT | `/api/v1/users/me/profile` | bearer | Update KYC profile |
| GET | `/api/v1/admin/users` | ADMIN | List all customer profiles |
| POST | `/api/v1/admin/users/{id}/kyc` | ADMIN | Set KYC status |

**Demo admin** (seeded at startup): `admin@bank.local` / `Admin123!`
(override via `ADMIN_EMAIL` / `ADMIN_PASSWORD`).

## Prerequisites

- Java 21, Maven (the `./mvnw` wrapper is included), Node 20+, Docker.

## Run locally

```bash
# 1. (optional) create your env file
cp .env.example .env

# 2. start Postgres + Redis  (host port 5433 -> container 5432)
docker compose up -d postgres redis

# 3. run the backend
cd backend && ./mvnw spring-boot:run
#   http://localhost:8080/actuator/health   -> {"status":"UP"}
#   http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui.html   -> API docs

# 4. run the frontend (in another terminal)
cd frontend && npm install && npm run dev
#   http://localhost:5173  -> shows "Backend: UP"
```

> **Port note:** the Docker Postgres is published on host port **5433** to avoid
> clashing with a local Postgres on 5432. Inside Docker it remains 5432.

### Run the whole stack in Docker

```bash
docker compose --profile full up --build
```

## Test

```bash
cd backend && ./mvnw verify   # runs the Testcontainers smoke test (real Postgres)
cd frontend && npm run build  # type-check + production build
```

## Layout

```
backend/     Spring Boot (modular packages under com.bank.*)
frontend/    React + TypeScript (Vite)

### Functions
No explicit functions or methods are declared here. The file is declarative, data-oriented, or framework configuration consumed by tools.

### Common Mistakes
- Editing this file without understanding which tool or framework consumes it.
- Changing names or paths without updating callers, imports, routes, migrations, or build configuration.
- Treating generated/runtime behavior as magic instead of following the call path from this file to its consumer.

### Possible Improvements
- Add targeted comments only where future readers need extra context.
- Add or update tests when behavior changes.
- Keep responsibilities narrow so the file remains easy to reason about.

## `docker-compose.yml`

### File Purpose
The local infrastructure definition: it starts PostgreSQL, Redis, and optionally the backend as containers.

**Why it exists:** This file owns one small part of the system so the rest of the project does not duplicate that responsibility.

**How the project depends on it:** Build tools, Spring Boot, React, tests, or runtime code load it from its path and expect the behavior described here.

**What would happen if removed:** The related module would fail to compile, lose a route/configuration/schema asset, or stop documenting an important workflow.

### Imports
No language-level imports are declared in this file. It either defines configuration/data, uses only built-in syntax, or is an asset/documentation file.
